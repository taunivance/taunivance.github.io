                <p>Visual Hierarchy is incredibly important in website design, and assists in helping users notice immediately
                   important information on a web page. Careful placement of elements on a webpage creates a sense of purpose 
                   and direction for your theme/product. Also, helps your user quickly navigate to their desired information.
                   I feel like RCOE displayed very good Visual Hierarchy with their text and color, making it very easy to know
                   where to navigate on the page</p>

                <p>White Space and Clean Design makes for and articulate and meaningful website design. Using white space evenly 
                    helps make your content easily scannable and improves significantly readability. Effective use of white space 
                    assists user in understanding your message quickly and concisely. Additionally, white space helps users to make 
                    logical sense of the information presented to them. I felt like accuquilt did a nice job implementing White Space,
                    which in turn helps visitors navigate much quicker through the website</p>

            <section class="alignment">
                <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
                <h4>Target</h4>
                <a href="https://www.target.com">https://www.target.com</a>
                <img src="images/target.jpg" alt="Target">
                <p>Alignment is important for making a very visually appealing website design. Alignment allows an observer to read 
                   the content more easily and clearly. This process is achieved by aligning your elements in such a way to establish 
                   order and avoid random positioning. Alignment like other design principle helps establish order in your website design.
                   I thought Target did a great job with Alignment. Their website has a very fluid and appealing design, which intices the 
                   users to navigate to multiple areas with ease.</p>
