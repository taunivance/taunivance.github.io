                    Riverside, throughout its history, has seen steady growth in population. Between 
                    the first censuses in 1890 and 1900, the city’s population grew by over 70%. By the 
                    1970s, the city had over 100,000 inhabitants. By the 1990s, the city had over 200,000 
                    residents. It reached another population milestone in 2010 when its population exceeded 
                    300,000. Recent estimates show that since the last official population in 2010, the 
                    community has grown by almost 7%, indicating that while growth has slowed, it will 
                    continue on a steady upward trajectory into the future.

                    The Serrano and Cahuilla people first inhabited the site of what is now Riverside. The 
                    first official record of the area was recorded in the 1770s following the exploration 
                    of Juan Bautista De Anza. It was officially founded much later, however, in 1869, although 
                    some sources claim that it wasn’t founded until the 1870s. It was in 1873 that seedless 
                    oranges from Brazil were planted, and Riverside’s temperate climate and other conditions 
                    were found to be favorable for growing the oranges, leading to a thriving citrus industry. 
                    Less than ten years later, close to half of the 500,000 citrus trees in the state were 
                    located in Riverside.
